 # RS-Flip-Flop
 Flip-Flops exploit [propagation delays](glossary://PropagationDelay) and [feedback loops](glossary://FeedbackLoop) to store one bit of data that persists even when its inputs are off.

 The one on the right is called an _RS-Flip-Flop_, which stands for _Reset-Set-Flip-Flop_.
 * _Reset_ (upper button) sets the flip-flop's value to zero, switching the LED off
 * _Set_ (lower button) sets the flip-flop's value to one, switching the LED off

 * Note:
 Enabling both switches at the same time is considered an invalid state that may lead to unexpected behaviour.
