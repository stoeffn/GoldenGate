 Unfortunately, time's up. Thank you for considering me for _WWDC18_!

 * Experiment:
 Feel free to play around with the components on the right and build some cool stuff!

 * Note:
 You can also scale, rotate, and pan in the simulator view. And also check out the more menu on the upper right!

 For additional inspiration, I've included some advanced examples on the next few pages, which you can modify as you likeâ€”have fun!
